<h3> Future plan and purpose: </h3>

<p> I want to be a Software Engineer. I want to build my own company. I would like to convert my company to Multinational Company. It's absolutely not needed to tell the importance of computer science in the modern world. Computer science has been here for mere more or less 40 years unlike other technologies that we use today. Many think that it has just started and has a long way to go.

I also think the same. Considering the disruptive revolution it has bring to the world in the past 2-3 decades, I think we have only uncovered a very small fraction of it's potential like the human brain.

We have still very little success in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. That's why, it's becoming one of the most interested subjects among students and scientists. We need more speed and more storage in order to cope with the large amount of rapidly flowing data each second. As a result of this, we need more power algorithms for the security of this data. We want more and more abstraction between the digital interfaces to make our lives easier.

Clearly, we have come a long way but we still have a long way to go. As long as there is human, there is computer science.
